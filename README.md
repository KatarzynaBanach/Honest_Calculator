**Honest_Calculator**

A calculator, that apart from it's normal function, comments on users calculating choices (in a pretty funny and mean way). Created while doing a course on hyperskill.org, based on general schema and guidelines provided by course author. I enjoyed creating this programm, and practing using of loops and checking conditions.
